So basically

Have directories for each Object

Decks
CardBody
...

and in those have files with names corresponding to the uriencoded id

Decks/1.json
Decks/2.json
...

Except CardBody which is grouped further by Deck Id

CardBody/1/1.json
CardBody/1/2.json
...
CardBody/2/1.json
CardBody/2/2.json
...

I think it will be as simple as that to code
