    Typesetting controls the readability of a text with the size, style, and spacing of its type. 
    Itâ€™s a function of microtypography (how text is styled within a text block) and macrotypography 
    (how content elements are arranged on the page). The more readable a text the more easily users 
    can understand its content. Text with poor readability turns off readers and can make it 
    challenging for them to stay focused.
